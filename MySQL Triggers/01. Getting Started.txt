The 5 main important points to know what are triggers 


1) A SQL trigger is a set of  SQL statements stored in the database catalog.

2) A SQL trigger is executed or fired whenever an event associated with a table occurs e.g.,  insert, update or delete.

3) A SQL trigger is a special type of stored procedure. 

4) It is special because it is not called directly like a stored procedure.

5) The main difference between a trigger and a stored procedure is that a trigger is called automatically when a data modification event is made against a table whereas a stored procedure must be called explicitly.
