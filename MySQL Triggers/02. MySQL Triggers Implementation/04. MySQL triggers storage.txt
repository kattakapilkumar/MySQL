MySQL stores triggers in a data directory e.g., /data/classicmodels/ with the files named tablename.TRG and triggername.TRN :




The tablename.TRG file maps the trigger to the corresponding table.
the triggername.TRN file contains the trigger definition.




You can back up the MySQL triggers by copying the trigger files to the backup folder.
