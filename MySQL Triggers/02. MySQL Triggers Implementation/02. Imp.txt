When you use a statement that does not use INSERT, DELETE or UPDATE statement 
to change data in a table, the triggers associated with the table are 
not invoked. For example, the TRUNCATE statement removes all data of a table but 
does not invoke the trigger associated with that table.






There are some statements that use the INSERT statement behind the scenes
 such as REPLACE statement or LOAD DATA statement. If you use these statements, 
the corresponding triggers associated with the table are invoked.
