MySQL triggers cover all features defined in the standard SQL. However, there are some limitations that you should know before using them in your applications.

MySQL triggers cannot:

Use SHOW, LOAD DATA, LOAD TABLE, BACKUP DATABASE, RESTORE, FLUSH and RETURN statements.
Use statements that commit or rollback implicitly or explicitly such as COMMIT , ROLLBACK , START TRANSACTION , LOCK/UNLOCK TABLES , ALTER , CREATE , DROP ,  RENAME.
Use prepared statements such as PREPAREand EXECUTE.
Use dynamic SQL statements.
