You must use a unique name for each trigger associated with a table. However, you can have 
the same trigger name defined for different tables though it is a good practice.



You should name the triggers using the following naming convention:

(BEFORE | AFTER)_tableName_(INSERT| UPDATE | DELETE)

For example, before_order_update is a trigger invoked before a row in the order table is updated.












The following naming convention is as good as the one above.

tablename_(BEFORE | AFTER)_(INSERT| UPDATE | DELETE)

For example, order_before_update is the same as before_update_update trigger above.
