Once you declared a variable, you can start using it. To assign a variable another value, you use the SET  statement, for example:


DECLARE total_count INT DEFAULT 0;
SET total_count = 10;
1
2
DECLARE total_count INT DEFAULT 0;
SET total_count = 10;
The value of the total_count variable is 10  after the assignment.

Besides the SET  statement, you can use the SELECT INTO  statement to assign the result of a query, which returns a scalar value, to a variable. See the following example:


DECLARE total_products INT DEFAULT 0

SELECT COUNT(*) INTO total_products
FROM products
1
2
3
4
DECLARE total_products INT DEFAULT 0
 
SELECT COUNT(*) INTO total_products
FROM products
In the example above:

First, we declare a variable named total_products  and initialize its value to 0.
Then, we used the SELECT INTO  statement to assign the total_products  variable the number of products that we selected from the products  table in the sample database.
