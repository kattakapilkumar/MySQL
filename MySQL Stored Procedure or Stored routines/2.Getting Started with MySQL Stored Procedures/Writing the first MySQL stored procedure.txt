Let’s examine the stored procedure in greater detail:

The first command is DELIMITER // , which is not related to the stored procedure syntax. The DELIMITER statement changes the standard delimiter which is semicolon ( ; ) to another. In this case, the delimiter is changed from the semicolon( ; ) to double-slashes // Why do we have to change the delimiter? Because we want to pass the stored procedure to the server as a whole rather than letting mysql tool interpret each statement at a time.  Following the END keyword, we use the delimiter //  to indicate the end of the stored procedure. The last command ( DELIMITER; ) changes the delimiter back to the semicolon (;).
We use the CREATE PROCEDURE  statement to create a new stored procedure. We specify the name of stored procedure after the CREATE PROCEDURE  statement. In this case, the name of the stored procedure is GetAllProducts . We put the parentheses after the name of the stored procedure.
The section between BEGIN and END  is called the body of the stored procedure. You put the declarative SQL statements in the body to handle business logic. In this stored procedure, we use a simple SELECT statement to query data from the products table.
